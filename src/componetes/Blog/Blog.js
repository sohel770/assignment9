            What is purpose of context API?

            Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree
            without having to pass props down manually at every level.The React
            Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global
            variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to
            "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent,
            and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to
            state management using Redux.React.createContext() is all you need.
            It returns a consumer and a provider. Provider is a component that
            as it's names suggests provides the state to its children. It will
            hold the "store" and be the parent of all the components that might
            need that store. Consumer as it so happens is a component that
            consumes and uses the state.

            What is symmetric tags?
          </h1>
          <p>
            One of the most important features of HTML5 is its
            semantics.Semantic HTML refers to syntax that makes the HTML more
            comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout
            of web pages. It makes web pages more informative and adaptable,
            allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret
            content.HTML5 semantic tags define the purpose of the element. By
            using semantic markup, you help the browser understand the meaning
            of the content instead of just displaying it. By providing this
            extra level of clarity, HTML5 semantic elements also help search
            engines to read the page and find the required information faster.
            For example header, nav, section, article, aside, and footer act
            more or less like div elements.

            <span className="font-bold">Inline</span> The element doesn’t start
            on a new line and only occupy just the width it requires. You can’t
            set the width or height. Compared to display: inline, the major
            difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and
            height on the element.{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">inline-block</span> It’s formatted just
            like the inline element, where it doesn’t start on a new line. BUT,
            you can set width and height values. inline-block It’s formatted
            just like the inline element, where it doesn’t start on a new line.
            BUT, you can set width and height values.Also, with display:
            inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but
            with display: inline they are not.
